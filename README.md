# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

### Use instructions:
* Up/down array key to increase/decrease array size
* Left/Right array key to decrease/increase step delay
* R key to randomize the array  
* N key to cycle through the themes

### Adding a custom theme:
* Go to `styles/` and add a file `styleX.conf`, replacing `X` with the next successive number, otherwise you won't be able to cycle to your theme
* Write a config file. Copy one of the provided configs and change to your liking. 
* Colors **must** be in format `red,green,blue` separated by commas, integers only. 
* Strings **must not** contain spaces.  
* In general, valid syntax is `attribute = new_value`, **all valid attributes are already given**.
* Invalid attributes **will be ignored**.
* Some attributes may be omitted. In such a case, values from the previous theme remain.
* Invalid syntax **will result in undefined behaviour**.
